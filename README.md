- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jose Calero @Jcaleriux 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™ve been interested in the entire field of informatics, from hardware to software. Iâ€™m passionate about learning almost anything related to technology.
However, thereâ€™s so much out there that itâ€™s impossible to learn it all. Iâ€™ve been focusing on programming, server administration, and networking.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Django, Vue.js, SQL, and Linux as I work on developing my personal project, FactuNet-App.
